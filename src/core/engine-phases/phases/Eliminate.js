/**
 * Any Minos marked for removal, i.e., on the hit list, are cleared from the 
 * Matrix in this phase. If this results in one or more complete 10-cell rows
 * in the Matrix becoming unoccupied by Minos, then all Minos above that row(s) 
 * collapse, or fall by the number of complete rows cleared from the Matrix. 
 * Points are awarded to the player according to the tetris Scoring System, as
 * seen in the scoring section.  game statistics  such as the number of Singles, 
 * doubles, triples, tetrises, and t-Spins can also be tracked in the eliminate 
 * Phase. Ideally, some sort of High Score table should record the playerâ€™s name, 
 * the highest level reached, his total score, and other statistics that can be 
 * tracked in this phase.
